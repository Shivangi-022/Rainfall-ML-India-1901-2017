# Rainfall-ML-India-1901-2017

Description:
This GitHub repository hosts a comprehensive machine learning project focused on the analysis and prediction of rainfall patterns in India from the year 1901 to 2017. The dataset utilized in this project encompasses meteorological data across various Indian subdivisions, providing a rich source of information for understanding the temporal and spatial dynamics of rainfall in the region.

Dataset: https://data.gov.in/resource/sub-divisional-monthly-rainfall-1901-2017

Key Features:
1. Preprocessing: The repository includes robust preprocessing techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and feature selection, ensuring the dataset is well-prepared for machine learning modeling.

2. Regression Modeling: Various regression algorithms are implemented to predict annual rainfall, with a particular emphasis on extracting monsoon-related features. The results aim to uncover the influential factors contributing to annual rainfall variations in different Indian subdivisions.

3. Classification Modeling: Monthly columns are selected as features to predict outcomes for two chosen subdivisions using classification algorithms. This analysis enhances our understanding of spatial and temporal variations in rainfall patterns across India.

4. Clustering Analysis: Clustering models are applied to explore the yearly variation of annual rainfall in a specific subdivision. This analysis identifies distinct patterns and trends over the studied period.

Outcome:
The repository's goal is to provide valuable insights into Indian monsoon dynamics, aiding in water resource management, agricultural planning, and disaster preparedness. Researchers, data scientists, and meteorologists can leverage this repository to explore and extend the analyses conducted on this comprehensive Indian rainfall dataset.
